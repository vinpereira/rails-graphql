# Rails with GraphQL

A simple case study of how to use GraphQL with Ruby on Rails

## Libraries used
- Ruby v2.4.1
- Rails v5.1.1

## Rails base structure
The project base code was created with the following command:
```sh
$ rails new rails-graphql --api
```
The _- -api_ option was used to create a lightweight version of the full-stack framework, containing only what I need start to build a REST API.
